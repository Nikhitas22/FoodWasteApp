Food waste management project
Food wastage is a serious issue affecting both the environment and the society. This Local Food Waste Management System aims to reduce food wastage by connecting **food providers** (like restaurants, hotels, or caterers) with **receivers** (such as NGOs and orphanages) who can make use of excess food.
